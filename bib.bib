  abstract	= {The temporal characteristics of the BOLD response in
		  sensorimotor and auditory cortices were measured in
		  subjects performing finger tapping while listening to
		  metronome pacing tones. A repeated trial paradigm was used
		  with stimulus durations of 167 ms to 16 s and intertrial
		  times of 30 s. Both cortical systems were found to be
		  nonlinear in that the response to a long stimulus could not
		  be predicted by convolving the 1-s response with a
		  rectangular function. In the short-time regime, the
		  amplitude of the response varied only slowly with stimulus
		  duration. It was found that this character was predicted
		  with a modification to Buxton's balloon model. Wiener
		  deconvolution was used to deblur the response to
		  concatenated short episodes of finger tapping at different
		  temporal separations and at rates from 1 to 4 Hz. While the
		  measured response curves were distorted by overlap between
		  the individual episodes, the deconvolved response at each
		  rate was found to agree well with separate scans at each of
		  the individual rates. Thus, although the impulse response
		  cannot predict the response to fully overlapping stimuli,
		  linear deconvolution is effective when the stimuli are
		  separated by at least 4 s. The deconvolution filter must be
		  measured for each subject using a short-stimulus paradigm.
		  It is concluded that deconvolution may be effective in
		  diminishing the hemodynamically imposed temporal blurring
		  and may have potential applications in quantitating
		  responses in eventrelated fMRI.},

		  paradigms have yet to fully convince of their ability to

		  sclerosis (HS). Patients were exposed to movie clips of

  abstract	= {Quantitative modeling of human brain activity can provide
		  crucial insights about cortical representations [1, 2] and
		  can form the basis for brain decoding devices [3-5]. Recent
		  functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have
		  modeled brain activity elicited by static visual patterns
		  and have reconstructed these patterns from brain activity
		  [6-8]. However, blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signals
		  measured via fMRI are very slow [9], so it has been
		  difficult to model brain activity elicited by dynamic
		  stimuli such as natural movies. Here we present a new
		  motion-energy [10, 11] encoding model that largely
		  overcomes this limitation. The model describes fast visual
		  information and slow hemodynamics by separate components.
		  We recorded BOLD signals in occipitotemporal visual cortex
		  of human subjects who watched natural movies and fit the
		  model separately to individual voxels. Visualization of the
		  fit models reveals how early visual areas represent the
		  information in movies. To demonstrate the power of our
		  approach, we also constructed a Bayesian decoder [8] by
		  combining estimated encoding models with a sampled natural
		  movie prior. The decoder provides remarkable
		  reconstructions of the viewed movies. These results
		  demonstrate that dynamic brain activity measured under
		  naturalistic conditions can be decoded using current fMRI

		  fact that there is not a single notion of independence or
		  lack of correlation. We distinguish three kinds: (1)
		  activity independence; (2) conditional independence; and
		  (3) information independence. Each notion is related to an
		  information measure: the information between cells, the
		  information between cells given the stimulus, and the

  abstract	= {Decoding the activity of a population of neurons is a
		  fundamental problem in neuroscience. A key aspect of this
		  problem is determining whether correlations in the
		  activity, i.e., noise correlations, are important. If they
		  are important, then the decoding problem is high
		  dimensional: decoding algorithms must take the
		  correlational structure in the activity into account. If
		  they are not important, or if they play a minor role, then
		  the decoding problem can be reduced to lower dimension and
		  thus made more tractable. The issue of whether correlations
		  are important has been a subject of heated debate. The
		  debate centers around the validity of the measures used to
		  address it. Here, we evaluate three of the most commonly
		  used ones: synergy, DeltaI(shuffled), and DeltaI. We show
		  that synergy and DeltaI(shuffled) are confounded measures:
		  they can be zero when correlations are clearly important
		  for decoding and positive when they are not. In contrast,
		  DeltaI is not confounded. It is zero only when correlations
		  are not important for decoding and positive only when they
		  are; that is, it is zero only when one can decode exactly
		  as well using a decoder that ignores correlations as one
		  can using a decoder that does not, and it is positive only
		  when one cannot decode as well. Finally, we show that
		  DeltaI has an information theoretic interpretation; it is
		  an upper bound on the information lost when correlations
		  are ignored.},

		  Interference trials contain number words that are
		  incongruent with the correct response (e.g., "two" written
		  three times), while neutral trials contain single semantic
		  category common animals (e.g., "bird"). Nine normal
		  right-handed adult volunteers underwent fMRI while

		  The performance data proved to be a useful guide in
		  analyzing the image data. The relative difference in

		  and variance estimates from the single-session level) can
		  be made equivalent to a single complete mixed-effects model
		  (where parameters of interest at the group level are
		  estimated directly from all of the original single
		  sessions' time series data) if the (co-)variance at the

		  the well-established "summary statistics" approach in FMRI.
		  The simple and generalized framework allows different

  abstract	= {Current analytical techniques applied to functional
		  magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data require a priori
		  knowledge or specific assumptions about the time courses of
		  processes contributing to the measured signals. Here we
		  describe a new method for analyzing fMRI data based on the
		  independent component analysis (ICA) algorithm of Bell and
		  Sejnowski ([1995]: Neural Comput 7:1129-1159). We
		  decomposed eight fMRI data sets from 4 normal subjects
		  performing Stroop color-naming, the Brown and Peterson
		  work/number task, and control tasks into spatially
		  independent components. Each component consisted of voxel
		  values at fixed three-dimensional locations (a component
		  "map"), and a unique associated time course of activation.
		  Given data from 144 time points collected during a 6-min
		  trial, ICA extracted an equal number of spatially
		  independent components. In all eight trials, ICA derived
		  one and only one component with a time course closely
		  matching the time course of 40-sec alternations between
		  experimental and control tasks. The regions of maximum
		  activity in these consistently task-related components
		  generally overlapped active regions detected by standard
		  correlational analysis, but included frontal regions not
		  detected by correlation. Time courses of other ICA
		  components were transiently task-related, quasiperiodic, or
		  slowly varying. By utilizing higher-order statistics to
		  enforce successively stricter criteria for spatial
		  independence between component maps, both the ICA algorithm
		  and a related fourth-order decomposition technique (Comon
		  [1994]: Signal Processing 36:11-20) were superior to
		  principal component analysis (PCA) in determining the
		  spatial and temporal extent of task-related activation. For
		  each subject, the time courses and active regions of the
		  task-related ICA components were consistent across trials
		  and were robust to the addition of simulated noise.
		  Simulated movement artifact and simulated task-related
		  activations added to actual fMRI data were clearly
		  separated by the algorithm. ICA can be used to distinguish
		  between nontask-related signal components, movements, and
		  other artifacts, as well as consistently or transiently
		  task-related fMRI activations, based on only weak
		  assumptions about their spatial distributions and without a
		  priori assumptions about their time courses. ICA appears to
		  be a highly promising method for the analysis of fMRI data
		  from normal and clinical populations, especially for
		  uncovering unpredictable transient patterns of brain
		  activity associated with performance of psychomotor
		  tasks.},

  abstract	= {This study describes a functional magnetic resonance
		  imaging study of humans engaged in long-term memory (LTM)
		  and working memory tasks. A pattern classifier learned to
		  identify patterns of brain activity associated with viewing
		  and making judgments about three categories of pictures
		  (famous people, famous locations, and common objects). The
		  evaluation of these stimuli relied on perception and
		  long-term semantic and/or episodic memories. We
		  investigated whether this classifier could successfully
		  decode brain activity from a subsequent delayed
		  paired-associate recognition working memory task that
		  required the short-term retention of the same stimuli. We
		  reasoned that the LTM-trained classifier would be able to
		  decode delay-period activity only if that activity
		  reflected, to some extent, the temporary activation of LTM.
		  Our results demonstrated successful decoding: delay-period
		  activity from a distributed network of brain regions
		  matched learned patterns of activity for task-relevant
		  stimuli to a greater extent than for task-irrelevant
		  stimuli. In varying degrees throughout the delay, activity
		  reflected the target (a retrospective code) and its
		  associate (a prospective code) with considerable
		  variability among subjects. Although prefrontal cortex
		  (PFC) demonstrated category-specific patterns of activity
		  during the LTM task, these patterns were not reinstated in

		  has been concerned with the segregation of mental events
		  into their presumed hierarchical processing stages, the
		  temporal aspect of such processing being termed 'mental
		  chronometry'. Advances in single-event functional magnetic
		  resonance imaging (fMRI) have allowed the extraction of
		  relative timing information between the onset of activity
		  in different neural substrates as well as the duration of
		  cognitive processing during a task, offering new
		  opportunities in the study of human perception and
		  cognition. Single-event fMRI studies have also facilitated
		  increased spatial resolution in fMRI, allowing studies of
		  columnar organization in humans. Important processes such
		  as object recognition, binocular vision and other processes
		  are thought to be organized at the columnar level; thus,
		  these advances in the spatial and temporal capabilities of
		  fMRI allow a new generation of cognitive and basic
		  neuroscience studies to be performed, investigating the
		  temporal and spatial relationships between these cortical
		  sub-units. Such experiments bear a closer resemblance to
		  single-unit or evoked-potential studies than to classical
		  static brain activation maps and might serve as a bridge
		  between primate electrophysiology and human studies. These
		  advances are initially demonstrated only in simple visual
		  and motor system tasks and it is likely to be several years

		  methods to process, analyze, and visualize fMRI data.We
		  first introduce a phase ambiguity correction scheme that
		  can be either applied subsequent to ICA of fMRI data or can
		  be incorporated into the ICA algorithm in the form of prior
		  information to eliminate the need for further processing
		  for phase correction. We also present a Mahalanobis

		  identification of voxels of interest. This method shows
		  particular promise for identifying voxels with significant

  abstract	= {Decoding perceptual or cognitive states based on brain
		  activity measured using functional magnetic resonance
		  imaging (fMRI) can be achieved using machine learning
		  algorithms to train classifiers of specific stimuli.
		  However, the high dimensionality and intrinsically low
		  signal to noise ratio (SNR) of fMRI data poses great
		  challenges to such techniques. The problem is aggravated in
		  the case of multiple subject experiments because of the
		  high inter-subject variability in brain function. To
		  address these difficulties, the majority of current
		  approaches uses a single classifier. Since, in many cases,
		  different stimuli activate different brain areas, it makes
		  sense to use a set of classifiers each specialized in a
		  different stimulus. Therefore, we propose in this paper
		  using an ensemble of classifiers for decoding fMRI data.
		  Each classifier in the ensemble has a favorite class or
		  stimulus and uses an optimized feature set for that
		  particular stimulus. The output for each individual
		  stimulus is therefore obtained from the corresponding
		  classifier and the final classification is achieved by
		  simply selecting the best score. The method was applied to
		  three empirical fMRI datasets from multiple subjects
		  performing visual tasks with four classes of stimuli.
		  Ensembles of GNB and k-NN base classifiers were tested. The
		  ensemble of classifiers systematically outperformed a
		  single classifier for the two most challenging datasets. In
		  the remaining dataset, a ceiling effect was observed which
		  probably precluded a clear distinction between the two
		  classification approaches. Our results may be explained by
		  the fact that different visual stimuli elicit specific
		  patterns of brain activation and indicate that an ensemble
		  of classifiers provides an advantageous alternative to
		  commonly used single classifiers, particularly when
		  decoding stimuli associated with specific brain areas.},

		  from brain activity alone? Recently, spatial patterns of

		  predict feature-specific stimulus representations for both
		  visible and invisible stimuli. However, because these
		  studies examined only the prediction of static and
		  unchanging perceptual states during extended periods of
		  stimulation, it remains unclear whether activity in early
		  visual cortex can also predict the rapidly and
		  spontaneously changing stream of consciousness. Here, we
		  used binocular rivalry to induce frequent spontaneous and
		  stochastic changes in conscious experience without any
		  corresponding changes in sensory stimulation, while
		  measuring brain activity with fMRI. Using information that
		  was present in the multivariate pattern of responses to
		  stimulus features, we could accurately predict, and
		  therefore track, participants' conscious experience from
		  the fMRI signal alone while it underwent many spontaneous
		  changes. Prediction in primary visual cortex primarily
		  reflected eye-based signals, whereas prediction in higher
		  areas reflected the color of the percept. Furthermore,
		  accurate prediction during binocular rivalry could be
		  established with signals recorded during stable monocular
		  viewing, showing that prediction generalized across viewing
		  conditions and did not require or rely on motor responses.

		  drawing (1 of 10 familiar objects, 5 tools and 5 dwellings,
		  such as a hammer or a castle). Here we demonstrate the
		  ability to reliably (1) identify which of the 10 drawings a
		  participant was viewing, based on that participant's
		  characteristic whole-brain neural activation patterns,
		  excluding visual areas; (2) identify the category of the
		  object with even higher accuracy, based on that
		  participant's activation; and (3) identify, for the first
		  time, both individual objects and the category of the
		  object the participant was viewing, based only on other
		  participants' activation patterns. The voxels important for
		  category identification were located similarly across
		  participants, and distributed throughout the cortex,
		  focused in ventral temporal perceptual areas but also
		  including more frontal association areas (and somewhat
		  left-lateralized). These findings indicate the presence of
		  stable, distributed, communal, and identifiable neural
		  states corresponding to object concepts.},

  abstract	= {We present a general method for the classification of
		  independent components (ICs) extracted from functional MRI
		  (fMRI) data sets. The method consists of two steps. In the
		  first step, each fMRI-IC is associated with an
		  IC-fingerprint, i.e., a representation of the component in
		  a multidimensional space of parameters. These parameters
		  are post hoc estimates of global properties of the ICs and
		  are largely independent of a specific experimental design
		  and stimulus timing. In the second step a machine learning
		  algorithm automatically separates the IC-fingerprints into
		  six general classes after preliminary training performed on
		  a small subset of expert-labeled components. We illustrate
		  this approach in a multisubject fMRI study employing visual
		  structure-from-motion stimuli encoding faces and control
		  random shapes. We show that: (1) IC-fingerprints are a
		  valuable tool for the inspection, characterization and
		  selection of fMRI-ICs and (2) automatic classifications of
		  fMRI-ICs in new subjects present a high correspondence with
		  those obtained by expert visual inspection of the
		  components. Importantly, our classification procedure
		  highlights several neurophysiologically interesting
		  processes. The most intriguing of which is reflected, with
		  high intra- and inter-subject reproducibility, in one IC
		  exhibiting a transiently task-related activation in the
		  'face' region of the primary sensorimotor cortex. This
		  suggests that in addition to or as part of the mirror
		  system, somatotopic regions of the sensorimotor cortex are
		  involved in disambiguating the perception of a moving body
		  part. Finally, we show that the same classification
		  algorithm can be successfully applied, without re-training,
		  to fMRI collected using acquisition parameters, stimulation
		  modality and timing considerably different from those used
		  for training.},

@Article{	  hinton2006,
  abstract	= {We show how to use "complementary priors" to eliminate the
		  explaining-away effects that make inference difficult in
		  densely connected belief nets that have many hidden layers.
		  Using complementary priors, we derive a fast, greedy
		  algorithm that can learn deep, directed belief networks one
		  layer at a time, provided the top two layers form an
		  undirected associative memory. The fast, greedy algorithm
		  is used to initialize a slower learning procedure that
		  fine-tunes the weights using a contrastive version of the
		  wake-sleep algorithm. After fine-tuning, a network with
		  three hidden layers forms a very good generative model of
		  the joint distribution of handwritten digit images and
		  their labels. This generative model gives better digit
		  classification than the best discriminative learning
		  algorithms. The low-dimensional manifolds on which the
		  digits lie are modeled by long ravines in the free-energy
		  landscape of the top-level associative memory, and it is
		  easy to explore these ravines by using the directed
		  connections to display what the associative memory has in
		  mind.},
